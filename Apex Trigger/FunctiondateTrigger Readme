Trigger Event: The trigger is set to execute after an update operation (after update) on the Event object.

Trigger Logic: When an Event record is updated, the trigger logic is executed, allowing you to define custom actions and behaviors.

Retrieving Updated Records: The trigger accesses the new version of the Event records using the Trigger.new variable. This variable contains the updated records that caused the trigger to fire.

Handling Specific Changes: You can examine the fields and values of the updated Event records to determine if specific changes have occurred. This can be done by comparing the new values with the previous values stored in the Trigger.oldMap variable.

Performing Actions: Based on the changes detected or any other criteria, you can perform various actions in response to the Event update. This may include updating related records, sending notifications, invoking other processes, or triggering additional workflows.

Error Handling: It's important to implement error handling in your trigger to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution. You can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions, allowing you to provide appropriate feedback or take corrective measures.

Trigger Execution: After performing the necessary actions, the trigger can perform additional database operations like updating or inserting records if required.
